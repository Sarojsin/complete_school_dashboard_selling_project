# Quick Start Guide

Get the School Management System running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher (3.13 recommended for best async performance)
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- Git

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Docker (Easiest - Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd school_dashboard_project

# 2. Start the application
make docker-up

# 3. Access the application
# Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000
```

That's it! The application is now running with a PostgreSQL database.

**Default Login Credentials:**
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- Teacher: `teacher` / `teacher123`
- Student: `student` / `student123`

### Method 2: Local Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd school_dashboard_project

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
make install
# Or: pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Setup PostgreSQL database
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE school_db;
CREATE USER school_user WITH PASSWORD 'school_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE school_db TO school_user;
\q

# 5. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials

# 6. Setup database and create default users
make setup
# Or: python setup_database.py

# 7. Run the application

lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Or use different port
python run.py --port 8080
```

### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
sudo systemctl status postgresql

# Verify database credentials in .env
cat .env

# Test database connection
psql -U school_user -d school_db -h localhost
```

### Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Fix upload directory permissions
chmod 755 app/static/uploads
```

### Docker Issues
```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## Next Steps

2. **Add Data**: Create courses, enroll students
3. **Configure**: Set up fee structures, schedules
4. **Test**: Create and take tests
5. **Deploy**: Follow DEPLOYMENT.md for production

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check README.md and IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Issues**: Create an issue on GitHub
- **Logs**: Check application logs for errors

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important for Production:**

1. Change default passwords immediately
2. Generate a secure SECRET_KEY
3. Set DEBUG=False
4. Configure ALLOWED_ORIGINS properly
5. Use HTTPS
6. Set up firewall rules
7. Enable rate limiting
8. Regular database backups

## Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes to code
vim app/routes/students.py

# 2. Run in development mode (auto-reload)
make dev

# 3. Test changes
make test

# 4. Format code
make format

# 5. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"
git push
```

## Performance Tips

- ✅ **AsyncPG**: Already using async database driver for maximum performance
- ✅ **Connection Pooling**: Configured in `app/core/database.py`
- ✅ **Eager Loading**: Relationships are eagerly loaded to prevent N+1 queries
- Enable caching for static files in production
- Use CDN for media files in production
- Monitor application performance with APM tools
- Scale horizontally with multiple workers using Gunicorn

## Updating the Application

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull

# Update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
make migrate

# Restart application
make dev  # or restart production server
```
